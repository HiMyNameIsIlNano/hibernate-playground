# Hibernate Playground

This is a simple archetype project I use to experiment with how `Hibernate` features work. 
The project comes with some predefined files that can be used to spin up a bare minimum
`Hibernate` configuration. The configuration enables `Hibernate` logging and a simple `h2` data source.
